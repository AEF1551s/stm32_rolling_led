# STM32 excercise 1  

This is simple excercise for STM32F410RBT6 microcontroller which is part of NUCLEO development board.  
The goal is to write a program for a scrolling LEDsr ow with at least nine LEDs and one button that changes the running direction when pressed.  

This project includes minimal headers for STM32F4xx.  
This project **does not** include any HAL header files.  

This project has been configured and generated by CubeIDE. Compiling and flashing is also done by CubeIDE.  

# Overview  
## Drivers  
Contains CMSIS drivers for STM32F4xx microcontrollers.  
## Inc  
Contains user defined header files.  
## Stc  
Contains user defined source files.  
## Startup  
Contains auto-generated STM32F410RBTx device vector table for GCC toolchain.  
## Other files
These are auto-generated files from CubeIDE and are nessecery if you want to replicate this project using CubeIDE.


# Prerequisites
## Linux based systems  
* CubeIDE installed. See `https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html`.  

# Build  
Use CubeIDE to build and flash the NUCLEO development board.
